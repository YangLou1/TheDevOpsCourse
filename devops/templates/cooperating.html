            <p>
                During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of trends in software
                development such as
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development">
                    Rapid-Application Development</a>,
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">
                    Scrum</a>,
                and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">
                    Extreme Programming</a>,
                led to the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile
                    Manifesto</a>, a summary of the lessons learned
                from applying these various practices over many years.
                Meanwhile, similar ideas, moving over from the world
                of manufacturing, in particular, from the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System">
                    Toyota Production System</a>,
                coalesced into
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">
                    Lean Programming</a>,
                which shared so many features with Agile that they can
                essentially be considered variants on a theme. (If we want to
                be good historians of software engineering practice, we
                must note that these ideas have earlier antecedents,
                particularly to be found in the group of brilliant
                engineers who worked at Bell Labs in the 1960s and 1970s,
                and who pioneered the notion of incremental development
                of small tools that could be easily combined into
                larger systems as the need arose, an idea at the heart
                of the UNIX operating system.)

            <p>
                These trends, along with the increasing viability of the Web
                as an application delivery platform, gave rise to development
                groups that could deliver new software to customers at an
                unprecedented pace. But this pace strained the capabilities of
                many operations teams: operations had traditionally acted as
                a regulator stopping buggy, insecure software from reaching
                production boxes. This job often delayed new software from
                reaching production for a number of months. When development
                cycles for new releases were measured in years, adding a few
                months to the release date was relatively unproblematic.
                But once development teams were ready to release new software
                much more frequently, often <i>daily</i>, adding a couple of
                month delay to a one-day release cycle no longer seemed
                acceptable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, operations, if it was not to be the fly in the ointment,
                had to become lean and agile itself. Practitioners realized
                that this required a new approach to operations: operations 
                had to work together with development from the very start of
                a project, to ensure that new software, at every step along
                its development path, was always "production ready." This 
                close collaboration between development and operations
                was christened with a name in 2008: in a talk on "Agile
                Infrastructure," Andrew Shafer and Patrick Debois coined the
                term "DevOps."
            </p>

            <p>
                So DevOps can be seen as an extension of Lean and Agile ideas
                into the realm of deploying software into production and
                monitoring and fixing it once it has been deployed. In order
                to accomodate the pace of release achieved by Lean/Agile
                developers, operations teams realized that operations had 
                to shift from a way of working where they were an
                after-the-fact check on the work of developers to one 
                in which they were involved in the development process
                from day one: operations has to swiftly provide developers
                with production-like environments in which to work
                (infra-structure as code), to enable quality assurance
                at every step of the development process (continuous, automated
                testing), to enable swift rollbacks when errors do appear in
                production (version control systems), and to constantly
                track the performance of these frequently released systems
                (automated monitoring).
            </p>

            <p>
                New developments in DevOps have extended this notion of 
                continual cooperation into the realms of security
                (<a
                    href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2015/08/27/secdevops-rugged-devops/">Rugged DevOps</a>),
                compliance, and even
                <a href="https://devops.com/measure-whats-important-devfinops/">
                    finance</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Perhaps the most important aspect of the DevOps movement, 
                however, is the idea of <i>continuous learning</i>: by speeding
                up the pace at which software is released by orders of
                magnitude (Amazon releases new code into production at
                an average pace of one release every 11 seconds), DevOps
                can enable organizations to <i>learn</i> much more swiftly,
                since it is by actually <i>using</i> new features that the
                customers can best provide feedback as to what is really
                helping them in their jobs, what is irrelevant, and what is
                positively harmful. Until a feature is actually being used by
                the customer, it is merely specualtion as to how important it
                is: once the customer can use it, they will let us know!
