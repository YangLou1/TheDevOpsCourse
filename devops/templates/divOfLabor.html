            DevOps and the Division of Labor
        </h1>

        <p> The benefits of the division of labor were, of course, recognized
        at least as far back as Plato and Xenophon.  Adam Smith famously
        expounded upon them in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>. In the early 20th
        century, this method of increasing productivity was pushed to its
        limits. Tasks were broken down to the extent that workers with minimal
        skills could be assigned simple, highly repetitive tasks, and perform
        them with almost no knowledge of what anyone else on the assembly line
        was up to.  </p>
        
        <p> Although this led to higher productivity of standardized products,
        the disadvantages of extending the division of labor to this extent
        were not overlooked. Karl Marx noted that the extensive division of
        labor alienated the worker from the product he was producing: someone
        who spends all day tightening a particular lug nut may be little able
        to associate what they do with "making a car." But even, Adam Smith,
        typically understood as a great proponent of the division of labor,
        commented: </p>
        
        <blockquote> In the progress of the division of labour, the employment
            of the far greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of
            the great body of people, comes to be confined to a few very simple
            operations, frequently to one or two. But the understandings of the
            greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary
            employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few
            simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the
            same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his
            understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out
            expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He
            naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and
            generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible to
            become for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind
            renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in
            any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble,
            or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment
            concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the
        great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether incapable
        of judging...  </blockquote>
        
        <p> Smith is pointing out a <i>general</i> problem with the extensive
        division of labor, but there is a much more <i>particular</i> problem,
        which only came to prominence in the recent days of increasing
        automation and increasing demand for innovative and customized
        products: the sort of mindless, production-line division of tasks
        common in mid-20th-century factories created a workforce downright
        <i>discouraged</i> from thinking about how their work fit into the
        production process as a whole, or how innovations in other parts they
        did not directly make might affect their own task. Such a holistic view
        was only supposed to be required of the engineers who designed new
        products or who designed the factory processes that would produce those
        new products. As in a socialist economy, all knowledge about the
        product and the production process would be concentrated at the top of
        a pyramid of work, and those below the peak were to just mindlessly
        follow the orders of those knowledge commissars.  </p>
        
        <p> A problem with this approach is that as products become more
        complicated and the pace of innovation increases, no single mind, or
        even a small group of minds, is capable of grasping all of the
        interconnections between the different parts of a complex product, and
        thus, cannot foresee how an innovation supposedly concerning only one
        part will actually have ripple effects on many other apparently
        separate production tasks. This fact was realized quite early at
        Toyota, and led to the invention of the <a
                                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System">Toyota
                                                Production System</a>, the
                                            forerunner of Lean Software
                                            Development.  </p>

        <p> As important as these ideas were in factory production, their
        importance is even greater in the world of software development, where
        production is <i>always</i> production of a novel product: otherwise,
        one would simply buy or rent an existing software product, which is
        almost always a lower cost venture than "rolling your own." </p>
        
        <p> In such an environment, it is simply not possible to assign the
        "workers" (programmers) a simple, repetitive task, and expect them to
        achieve decent results without at least some understanding of the
        overall product design, as well as an understanding of how their
        particular "part" integrates with the other parts of the product as a
        whole. In such a situation, worker obedience no longer "works." A
        manager cannot tell a software engineer working on a product of even
        moderate complexity to just follow the manager's orders: the programmer
        can bring production to a halt simply by asking, "OK, what line of code
        should I write next?" </p>
        
        <p> But further: no knowledge worker producing an even moderately
        complex product can do his work properly without his understanding of
        his part in the production process evolving in continuous interaction
        with the evolving understanding of all of the other knowledge workers
        involved in the product: one such worker gaining a better understanding
        of the nature of her component simply <i>must</i> convey that
        understanding to all other workers upon whom the changes in her
        component have an impact, and that set of workers typically encompasses
        <i>everyone</i> working on the product.  </p>
        
        <p>
         The various aspects of "DevOps" production follow from the nature of
        knowledge workers cooperating to create innovative products.
        Programmers cannot do their jobs in isolation: thus, <i>continuous
            integration</i>. Testers cannot test successfully unless they are
        part of the production process from day one: thus, <i>continuous
            testing</i>. Operations cannot successfully deploy constantly
        evolving products unless deployment itself becomes a software
        product: thus, <i>software as infrastructure</i>. The "business"
        stakeholders in the product cannot ensure the product is really meeting
        business needs unless they are continually engaged in the development
        process: thus the lean and agile principles of <i>continual
            interaction</i> between the engineers and
        the "business people." How new versions of a piece of software impact
        the end users cannot be determined without continual feedback from
        those users: thus, <i>incremental development</i>, <i>continuous
            deployment</i>, and <i>continuous
        monitoring</i>. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
         And since, in our brave new world, <a
            href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/04/22/twims-prince-magic-leap-hbr-software-intel-minecraft/">every
            business is a software business</a>, no business that wants to
        survive can ignore the DevOps revolution.
