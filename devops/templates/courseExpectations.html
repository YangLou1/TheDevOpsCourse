        <ul>
            <li>
                Attend all sessions: these are crucial stand-up meetings where
                we coordinate our work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Work steadily: it is completely anti-DevOps to try to finish
                your work in a rush at the end of the semester. If you attempt
                to do this, you will fail the course, <i>regardless of whether
                you submit "good" work or not</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Purchase at least one of the books on the DevOps reading list.
            </li>
        </ul>
