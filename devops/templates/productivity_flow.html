I just noticed that it is February, and I already can see I will publish <a
href="https://gcallah.github.io/BookReviews/index.html">at least seven book
reviews</a> this year, already tying my best year so far (2016). If I keep my
pace up, I should be able to knock off between 15 and 20. This is happening as
I am <i>limiting</i> the number of book reviews I take on.
</p>

<p>
And I did this following the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">kanban</a> idea of
limiting work-in-progress, to create flow and avoid waste. I realized that the
economic distinction between <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow">stocks and flows</a> in
economics can clarify what is going on here.

Too many people, including me a year ago, confuse having a large <i>stock</i>
of jobs in progress with productivity. In this view, to be productive is to be
<i>busy</i>. If I was juggling six book reviews, "Boy," I thought, "I sure am
productive!"
</p>

<p>
But productivity is a <i>flow</i>, not a stock! What matters is not how many
things you are up to, but how many <i>finished products</i>* are coming out of
your "workstation." And perhaps paradoxically, we can often increase our
<i>flow</i> by decreasing our <i>stock</i>: our work tends to behave somewhat
like a highway: the highway can deliver more cars from point A to point B by
putting more cars on the highway, <i>up to a certain point</i>. But beyond that
point, we start to get traffic jams, and if we fill the highway with as many
cars as it will fit, traffic comes to almost a complete stop.
</p>

<p>
If you want to be productive, aim to maximize the flow of work through your
hands, not the amount of work you take on.

<p>
* Or at least products with <i>your</i> part finished, if you work in
cooperative production of some final product.
