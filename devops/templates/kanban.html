            Too often, people come to believe they are productive because they
            are <i>doing</i> lots of things. If you asked them for evidence of
            their productivity, they would show you all of the tasks "on their
            plate," i.e., their to-do list.

           This brings us to the distinction in economics between "stocks" and
           "flows." Certain things in economics, such as the number of
           factories a business owns, or the amount of capital an investor has
           on hand, are a stock: what we are looking to measure here is an
           amount that exists at a certain point in time. But other economic
           phenomena are better understood as a flow: e.g., our companies
           factories can produce 100 automobiles <i>per hour</i>, or an investor's
           capital produces a 5% return <i>per year</i>.

            The point of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">kanban boards</a>
            is to emphasize that one's productivity
            is a flow, and not a stock. One is productive to the extent that
            one moves products further down the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream">value
            stream</a>, and not to the extent that one has stacked up lots of
            unfinished projects at one's work station.
